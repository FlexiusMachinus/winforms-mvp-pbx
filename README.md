This repository includes a desktop application for a simple PBX phone system developed developed as part of a term project on software development.
The application was created using Windows Forms and MVP architecture on the .NET Framework 4.8 platform.
Entity Framework 6 was used as data access to the MS SQL Server database (code-first approach).
Application logic (except for primitive logic in views) was covered by unit tests (MSTest + Moq framework).

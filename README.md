This project includes a desktop application for a PBX phone system.
The application was created using Windows Forms on .NET Framework 4.8 platform with MVP architecture in mind.
Entity Framework 6 was used as data access to the MS SQL Server database (code-first approach).
Application logic (excluding primitive logic in views) was covered by unit tests (MSTest + Moq framework).
